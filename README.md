Haiprompt
=============

Minimalistic, simple zsh prompt with a nifty unicode character from japanese katakana.

Features:
- git support (showing if repository is _dirty_)
- python virtualenv support

Installation
============

```
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom
git clone https://github.com/awinecki/haiprompt
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
ln -s ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/haiprompt/haiprompt.zsh-theme
```

Or, you can always manually copy the file to oh-my-zsh themes directory, or use antigen.

Enjoy!

Special thanks to dhruvasagar, amuse theme author (this theme is heavily based on amuse).
